# Implement-a-Matrix-Class-
Project of nano degree from Udacity - Intro to self-driving cars


## Project Overview

In this project you will implement a `Matrix` class in Python. Specifically, you will implement the following methods:


**class Matrix:**
  def **_determinant_**(self):
      # your code


  def **_trace_**(self):
      # your code


  def **_inverse_**(self):
      # your code


  def **_transpose_**(self):
     # your code


  #Overloaded operators


  def **__add__**(self,other):
    # your code


  def **__sub__**(self,other):
    # your code


  def **__mul__**(self,other):
    # your code
