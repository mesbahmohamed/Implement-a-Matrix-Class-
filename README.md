# Implement-a-Matrix-Class-
Project of nano degree from Udacity - Intro to self-driving cars


## Project Overview

In this project you will implement a `Matrix` class in Python. Specifically, you will implement the following methods:


**class Matrix:**
  def **_determinant_**(self):
      # your code


  def **_trace_**(self):
      # your code


  def **_inverse_**(self):
      # your code


  def **_transpose_**(self):
     # your code


  #Overloaded operators


  def **__add__**(self,other):
    # your code


  def **__sub__**(self,other):
    # your code


  def **__mul__**(self,other):
    # your code
    
    
    
## Project Instructions  

project workspace will contain several files

1. `matrix.py` - This contains the beginnings of a Matrix class (which you will complete) as well as some helper functions zeroes and identity. **This is the main file for most of work.**


2. `matrix_playground.ipynb` - A notebook that imports your Matrix class and calls the test code. You may find it useful to use this notebook as a place to use the matrix math code you will write in matrix.py.


3. `matrix_cheat_sheet.ipynb` - A Jupyter notebook with a **glossary, explanation of matrix notation** and list of **matrix equations**. Use this as a reference when filling out the methods in the Matrix class!


4. `kalman_filter_demo.ipynb` - You don't need to do anything with this notebook but you may find it interesting. Once your matrix class is working properly, the KF implemented here will actually work!
Other Files (feel free to ignore).

**Other files**
5. `test.py` - Contains test code which demonstrates the expected functionality of your code.
6. `datagenerator.py` - this just contains some helper code which is used by the Kalman Filter.

You can ignore **datagenerator.py** and **test.py** as no need to modify
